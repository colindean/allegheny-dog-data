Allegheny County Dog License database crawler
=============================================

This little program automates the export of CSV data from the
[Allegheny County Dog License Database](http://infoportal.alleghenycounty.us/dogdata/default.aspx).

This data is made available in CSV format, but the export is only per year. This script gets all of the years (eventually) and not only combines them in a CSV file, but also as an sqlite3 database.
